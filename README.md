# Roman Trade Network üè∫

This project models a **spatial and social network** for Roman pottery trade using **graph theory**. It allows traders to find the shortest routes, optimize supply and demand, and simulate trading.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Graph-based spatial network**: Locations connected via roads.
- **Trader social network**: Traders exchange information.
- **Shortest path calculation**: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Optimized trading**: Ensures efficient supply and demand distribution.
- **Iterative trading**: Simulates multiple trading rounds.

## üìå How It Works

This project simulates a **trade network** where traders move pottery between locations based on **supply and demand**. The system is modeled using **graph theory**, where:

- **Locations** are represented as nodes.
- **Roads** between locations are edges with distances.
- **Traders** operate within a social network to exchange information and goods.

The program determines the best **trade routes** and **optimizes transactions** to balance supply and demand.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating the Spatial Network**
The road system is stored as a **graph**, where each location is a node, and the roads between them are weighted edges representing distances.

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing the Project with `main.py`

To see the Roman Trade Network in action, you can **run `main.py`**, which contains example functions demonstrating how the system works.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script**
Make sure you're in the project directory and run:

```sh
python main.py
